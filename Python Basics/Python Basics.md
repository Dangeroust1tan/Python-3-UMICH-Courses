## Week 2 Overview

In week two, you will use the lectures and the Runestone textbook to understand the basics of a few Python data types—lists, strings, tuples—as well as a control structure—for loops. By the end of this week, you will be able to write more complex programs that create drawings by incorporating for loops. Finally, we will present the basics of an accumulation pattern to you, which will be expanded on in each week for the rest of the course.
