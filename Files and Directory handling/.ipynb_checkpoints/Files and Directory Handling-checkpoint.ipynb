    "# Python Functions, Files, and Dictionaries Course\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This course introduces the dictionary data structure and user-defined functions. You’ll learn about local and global variables, optional and keyword parameter-passing, named functions and lambda expressions. You’ll also learn about Python’s sorted function and how to control the order in which it sorts by passing in another function as an input. For your final project, you’ll read in simulated social media data from a file, compute sentiment scores, and write out .csv files. It covers chapters 10-16 of the textbook “Fundamentals of Python Programming,” which is the accompanying text (optional and free) for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course is well-suited for you if you have already taken the \"Python Basics\" course and want to gain further fundamental knowledge of the Python language. Together, both courses are geared towards newcomers to Python programming, those who need a refresher on Python basics, or those who may have had some exposure to Python programming but want a more in-depth exposition and vocabulary for describing and reasoning about programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a follow-up to the \"Python Basics\" course (course 1 of the Python 3 Programming Specialization), and it is the second of five courses in the specialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Week 1 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In week one, the video lectures and the Runestone textbook will introduce you to the idea of incorporating files into your programs as an additional source of data. You will learn how to read from a file, write to a file, and how to work with the .csv data format.\n",

    "In week three, you will be introduced to the construction of functions. Up to this point, you have used functions in the programs before, but have not had a chance to write your own functions, including how to define a function, how to incorporate parameters, how to return data from a function, the local or global scope of variables, and potential side effects that could occur from function execution. Finally, we look at tuples more in depth, and how automatic packing and unpacking of tuples can be used in functions and in for loops.\n",

You will submit a csv file as well as images of graphs that demonstrate your findings.\n",
